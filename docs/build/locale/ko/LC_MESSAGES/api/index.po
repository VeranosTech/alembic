"Alembic's internal API has many public integration points that can be "
"used to extend Alembic's functionality as well as to re-use its "
"functionality in new ways.   As the project has grown, more APIs are "
"created and exposed for this purpose."

"Direct use of the vast majority of API details discussed here is not "
"needed for rudimentary use of Alembic; the only API that is used normally"
" by end users is the methods provided by the :class:`.Operations` class, "
"which is discussed outside of this subsection, and the parameters that "
"can be passed to the :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure` method, used "
"when configuring one's ``env.py`` environment.  However, real-world "
"applications will usually end up using more of the internal API, in "
"particular being able to run commands programmatically, as discussed in "
"the section :doc:`/api/commands`."
